    "    * 0 is no plagiarism, coded with Category 'non'.\n",
    "    * 1 is that there was low use of the original file, coded with Category 'heavy' to indicate heavy revision of text from the original answer.\n",
    "    * 2 is that there was medium use of the original file, coded with Category 'light' to indicate only light revision text from the original answer.\n",
    "    * 3 is that there was heavy plagiarism of the original file, coded with Category 'cut' to indicate the answer was cut and pasted 'as-is' from original answer (no revision).\n",

    "One of the ways we might go about detecting plagiarism, is by computing **similarity metrics** that measure how similar a given text answer is as compared to the original wikipedia answer (for a specific task, a-e). The similarity metrics we will use are informed by the [plagiarism paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/January/5c412841_developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers/developing-a-corpus-of-plagiarised-short-answers.pdf) that is also linked at the top of this notebook. In this paper, researchers created features called **containment** and **longest common subsequence**. \n",

    "Let's talk a bit more about what features we want to include in a plagiarism detection model and to calculate such features. In the following explanations, I'll refer to a submitted text file as a **Student Task Answer Text** and the original, wikipedia source file (that we want to compare that answer to) as the **Wikipedia Task Text**.\n",

    "### Containment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task will be to create **containment features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Containment is defined as the **intersection** of the n-gram word count of the Wikipedia Task Text with the n-gram word count of the Student Task Answer Text *divided* by the n-gram word count of the Student Task Answer Text. In other words, this is a measure, between 0 and 1, of how many n-grams these two texts have in common; you can calculate this value using count or tf-idf vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, it will be up to you to decide on the appropriate `n` or several useful `n`'s to use in your final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXERCISE: Create containment features\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the dataframe that you've created, you should have all the information you need to compare any Student Task Answer Text with its appropriate Wikipedia Task Text (the source text). An answer for task A should be compared to the source text for task A, just as answers to task's B, C, D, and E should be compared to the corresponding original source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll complete the function, `calculate_containment` which calculates containment based upon an passed in dataframe (such as the one you created above with all the text and task information), an input *n-gram* size (a positive integer), which is used to create a specific n-gram containment value, and a file_index, which specifies the row number of the file we are interested in calculating the containment value of.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for completing this exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps to complete this function are as follows, given a passed in dataframe and n-gram length like 1, 2, 3, etc.\n",
    "1. Calculate n-gram counts for every one of our 100 files. It is suggested that you use a [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) or [TfidfVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) that can count n-grams when applied to a text.\n",
    "2. For the specified Student Task Answer Text (as specified by `file_index`, compare it's n-gram count to the corresponding Wikipedia Task Text n-gram count to calculate the containment, according to the equation below: the intersection of the source and student n-gram counts *divided* by the student n-gram count.\n",
    "\n",
    "    >$$ \\frac{\\text{n-gram}_{student} \\cap \\text{n-gram}_{original}}{\\text{n-gram}_{student}} $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Return the containment value for that file.\n",
