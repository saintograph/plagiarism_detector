There are a large number of models used in solving the problem of Information Retrieval and they are all based on one of three mathematical bases: set theory, algebra and probabilistic.  The vector space model is one of these methods, and it is an algebraic model.

In the vector space model a document is represented as a vector.  Within this vector, each dimension corresponds to a separate term (where a term is typically a single word, keyword or phrase.)  If the term doesn
