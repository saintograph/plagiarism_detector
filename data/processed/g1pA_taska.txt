In object oriented programming, objects are grouped together into classes according to their type, structure and the functions that can be performed on them. Inheritance is a process in object oriented programming in which objects acquire (or inherit) the properties of objects of another class. It is therefore used to create relationships between one object and another. Each class groups together objects of a similar type, with similar properties. New classes can be formed by this process whose objects will have properties of both the classes from which this new class is formed. A superclass has all of the properties of the subclasses below it. At the same time subclasses are each distinctive from each other but related via the superclass. Subclasses are said to
